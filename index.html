I have been working in the IT industry for 10+ years.<br><br> As a full-stack engineer, I am experienced using the Reactive paradigm proposed by React and React Native, and it's my preferred approach to write web and mobile applications at this point. Besides that, I had multiple experiences working with a wide variety of frameworks, libraries and languages such as Ruby on Rails, Node + Express, AngularJS, iOS (Obj-C), PHP (Doctrine and Symphony), Java, C, C++, C#. I had to work with designing databases and queries for SQL (Postgres and MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB) throughout my career. <br><br>I have an organized discourse and receptive skills. I love to collaborate with multidisciplinary, creative, and innovative teams, and I always use empathy and keep my mind open to hear and comprehend others. I consider myself very attentive and receptive to clients/product owners' needs, and I am always willing to solve problems through clear communication and dialog.</p>
