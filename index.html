                        <b>Hello! First and foremost: Thanks for landing in my website.</b><br>
                        <b>I'm Hernan Albano</b>, a seasoned engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay üá∫üáæ. With 13+ years in the IT sector, I've worked across a wide variety of projects and garnered a wealth of experience.<br><br> 
                        As a dedicated full-stack engineer, I have extensive knowledge in the Reactive paradigm proposed by React and React Native and it is currently my go-to methodology for creating web and mobile applications. However, my technical knowledge goes beyond the Frontend; I've hands-on experience with a diverse range of frameworks, libraries, and languages, including Ruby on Rails, Node with Express and Mongo, Angular and AngularJS, Objective-C, PHP (Doctrine + Symphony), Java, C, C++, C#. When it comes to databases, I'm adept at pinpointing the ideal choice for a project's needs, be it SQL or NoSQL. I've worked extensively with Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB, and I pride myself on my ability to design robust relational databases and craft efficient queries. <br><br>
                        Effective communication is one of my strong suits. I cherish opportunities to collaborate with multidisciplinary, inventive teams. My approach is grounded in respect, ensuring I listen actively and understand others' perspectives. Detail-oriented and quick-thinking, I'm always attuned to clients' or product owners' requirements. My goal is to resolve challenges through open dialogue and clear communication.

I see myself as a bit of an anthropologist, that likes to discover the local voices in the places I visit. I really enjoy having the next adventure booked. Although, with parenting, the nature of those adventures has transformed a bit‚Äîmuch to my delight!</p>

                        <p class="description">To counteract the sedentary nature of my work, I immerse myself in various sports. I have a fondness for running and biking, and have participated in several competitions. Currently, I'm diving deeper into calisthenics and making significant progress in kettlebell training. Moreover, I'm dedicated to enhancing my swimming skills, a pursuit I find both challenging and invigorating.</p>
